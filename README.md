# LVO-BOT
Discord Bot that plays music and retrieves images from danbooru (as of this update).


# TODO
- display song title instead of URL when using !queue
- respond with in a variety of sussy ways when using !sus
- write a proper formatted README and add comments/documentation
- administrative abilites, ensure ready for public use
- expand danbooru capabilities
- add cooldowns to commands
- change output messages to embeds (or something consistent)

# KNOWN BUGS
- Sometimes gets stuck in queue and stops playing entirely. Occurs when a song is queued right as a song ends when the queue is empty. Requires bot to rejoin vc to fix.
- Music quality speeding up or down is a result of my internet.
